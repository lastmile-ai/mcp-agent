# Clarification Prompt

Generate smart, efficient clarifying questions for **{company_name}** marketing content requests.

## Request Context
- **Company**: {company_name}
- **Industry**: {industry}
- **Platform**: {platform}
- **Request**: "{request}"
- **Target Audience**: {target_audience}
- **Brand Personality**: {brand_personality}

## Clarification Philosophy

### Core Principle
**Generate only questions that will meaningfully improve content quality while respecting the user's time.**

### Quality Over Quantity
- Maximum 3 questions total
- Prefer 1-2 high-impact questions
- Each question should address a genuine information gap
- Focus on essential missing information, not nice-to-have details

### Efficiency Focus
- Quick to answer (30 seconds or less per question)
- Specific rather than open-ended when possible
- Provide multiple choice options where appropriate
- Build on existing context rather than asking for redundant information

## Question Categories & Impact Assessment

### **HIGH IMPACT** (Priority 1 - Ask these first)

#### Campaign Objective Questions
**When to ask**: Goal isn't clear from request or context
- "What's the main goal of this {platform} post?"
  - **Options**: awareness, lead generation, event promotion, product announcement, thought leadership
  - **Impact**: Fundamentally changes content approach and call-to-action

#### Content Focus Questions  
**When to ask**: Topic is broad or could have multiple angles
- "What should we highlight about [specific topic]?"
  - **Options**: benefits, features, use cases, success stories, technical details
  - **Impact**: Determines content angle and key messaging

#### Call-to-Action Questions
**When to ask**: Next step isn't obvious for engagement/conversion content
- "What should readers do after seeing this?"
  - **Options**: visit website, sign up, download, attend event, contact sales, share content
  - **Impact**: Affects content structure and closing

### **MEDIUM IMPACT** (Priority 2 - Ask if space allows)

#### Audience Specification Questions
**When to ask**: Multiple audience segments could apply
- "Who specifically within our {target_audience} should this reach?"
  - **Options**: specific roles, experience levels, company sizes, geographic regions
  - **Impact**: Influences tone, examples, and messaging complexity

#### Tone Refinement Questions
**When to ask**: Multiple appropriate tones exist for the platform/topic
- "What tone works best for this content?"
  - **Options**: professional, conversational, technical, inspirational, urgent
  - **Impact**: Affects voice and engagement style

#### Timing Context Questions
**When to ask**: Content might be time-sensitive or campaign-related
- "Is this connected to a specific event or campaign?"
  - **Options**: product launch, industry event, seasonal campaign, news response
  - **Impact**: Adds urgency and relevant context

### **LOW IMPACT** (Priority 3 - Usually skip unless critical)

#### Format Preference Questions
- Usually skip - we know platform best practices

#### Company Background Questions  
- Usually skip - we have company documentation

#### General Messaging Questions
- Usually skip - covered in brand guidelines

## Smart Question Generation Framework

### Pre-Question Analysis
Before generating questions, assess:

1. **Context Richness**: How much relevant information is already available?
2. **Request Specificity**: How detailed and clear is the original request?
3. **Platform Norms**: What are typical content patterns for {platform}?
4. **Company Patterns**: What does {company_name} usually create for this type of request?

### Question Quality Standards

#### **GOOD QUESTIONS**
- Address genuine information gaps
- Have clear impact on content quality
- Easy to answer quickly
- Build on existing context
- Lead to actionable content decisions

#### **AVOID QUESTIONS THAT**
- Ask for information already in context
- Are too broad or philosophical
- Don't significantly impact content quality
- Take too long to answer thoughtfully
- Duplicate information from other sources

### Contextual Decision Making

#### **HIGH CLARIFICATION SCENARIOS**
- Very short requests (under 5 words)
- Ambiguous goals for the platform
- Multiple possible interpretations
- Missing critical campaign context
- Unclear target within audience

#### **MEDIUM CLARIFICATION SCENARIOS**  
- Generally clear but could be more specific
- Standard request type but unique angle possible
- Platform-appropriate but generic topic
- Good context but missing one key element

#### **LOW/NO CLARIFICATION SCENARIOS**
- Detailed, specific requests
- Clear goal and context from URL content
- Standard content type with obvious approach
- Rich context that answers most questions
- Platform-appropriate with clear direction

## Platform-Specific Question Strategies

## Response Optimization

### Question Structure
Each question should include:

### User Experience Considerations
- Lead with most important question

### Smart Defaults and Assumptions
When in doubt:
- Assume standard platform goals ({platform} typical objectives)
- Default to primary audience segment for {company_name}
