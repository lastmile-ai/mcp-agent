Everyone's defaulting to AI for writing these days. Tried it yourself? 🖋️

And now every em-dash makes you wonder... human author or ChatGPT at work? 🤔

Hot take: It's less about *who* wrote it and more about *what* they wrote. Authentic? Or fluff? 🤷‍♂️

As an engineer and immigrant, I've always been translating thoughts. LLMs helped—but the tone? Rhythm? Disappeared.

My draft cycle: write → prompt → rewrite → "eh, still not me."

So, built my own writing agent:
- **Learns** my style (memory!)
- **Cleans** drafts without killing my tone
- **Adapts** for Reddit, LinkedIn, Twitter

Built on mcp-agent by Lastmile AI:
- Filesystem, memory, markitdown integration
- Makes content flow everywhere

I say: 
- "Rewrite this LinkedIn draft."
- "Turn this convo into a Reddit post."

This post? Drafted by me. Agent-tweaked. Then me again. Just enough AI—not too much.

Want the code? Happy to share. Let's keep it real. ✌️
